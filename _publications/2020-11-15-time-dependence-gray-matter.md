title: "In vivo observation and biophysical interpretation of time-dependent diffusion in human cortical gray matter"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-11-15-time-dependence-gray-matter
excerpt: 'In vivo diffusion MRI and Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the restriction along neurites is short-range disorder, and the diffusivity and kurtosis time-dependence scales as 1/âˆšt. The 1-dimensional simulation code and power spectrum analysis can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/NYU-DiffusionMRI/monte-carlo-simulation-1D-membrane)'
