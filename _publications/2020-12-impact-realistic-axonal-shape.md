collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-12-impact-realistic-axonal-shape
excerpt: 'Monte Carlo simulation of diffusion inside realistic axonal shapes segmented from electron microscopy data of a mouse brain. (i) In the narrow pulse limit, the inner diameter from radial diffusivity is overestimated by about twofold due to a combination of axon caliber variations and undulations (each contributing a comparable effect size); (ii) The narrow-pulse radial kurtosis deviates from that in an ideal cylinder due to caliber variations; we also numerically calculate the fourth-order cumulant for an ideal cylinder in the wide pulse limit, which is relevant for inner diameter overestimation; (iii) In the wide pulse limit, the axon diameter overestimation is mainly due to undulations at low diffusion weightings b; and (iv) The effect of undulations can be considerably reduced by directional averaging of high-b signals, with the apparent inner diameter given by a combination of the axon caliber (dominated by the thickest axons), caliber variations, and the residual contribution of undulations.'
