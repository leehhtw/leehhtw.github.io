permalink: /publication/2019-02-21-mouse-brain-EM
excerpt: 'We developed a semi-automatic algorithm to segmented myelinated axons in the electron microscopy data of a mouse brain sample and analyzed its micro-geometry, such as axonal diameter, caliber variation, axonal undulation, and fiber orientation dispersion. The segmentation and analysis code can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/NYU-DiffusionMRI/RaW-seg).'
